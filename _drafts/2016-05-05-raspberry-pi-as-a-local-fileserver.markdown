excerpt: A sample draft post.

The Raspberry Pi (connected to appropriate hard-drives) is a good option because:

* It is easy to set up
* It is cheap
* It has low power consumption (and hence is cheap to run)
* There is a huge user-community and excellent documentation

This is just a sample draft post.

To view all drafts just run:

    jekyll server --drafts

Drafts will be assigned dates based on when they were last modified.

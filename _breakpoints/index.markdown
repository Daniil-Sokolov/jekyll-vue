These breakpoints need not be totally fixed - but they're a good guide to basic responsive layouts. In particular, an extra breakpoint might be needed at 320px and below.

***

<h2 id ="xs">Extra Small Screens/Phone</h2>
**480px and below**

***

<h2 id="sm">Small Screen/Tablet</h2>
**481px to 768px**

***

<h2 id="md">Medium Screen/Desktop</h2>
**769px to 992px**

***

<h2 id="lg">Large Screen/Wide Desktop</h2>
**993px to 1200px**

***

<h2 id="xl">XL Desktop</h2>
**wider than 1200px**

***

Closely based on [Twitter Bootstrap 3.x](http://getbootstrap.com/) breakpoints.
